<h1>Death to Bullshit</h1>

<h1><a href="http://vimeo.com/63437853">Death to Bullshit</a></h1>
<p>
Our speaker Brad Frost opens up his speech by throwing a lot of statistics at us. 10% of all books in the world were made in the last year. He also informs us of the significant number of photos and content posted on social media platforms such as Facebook and Instagram. His main point in regards to this is that the internet has become extremely cluttered or in his words filled with “bullshit.” He goes on to rant about how we can’t visit websites these days without some overlay popping up with an advertisement or something of that nature to distract us. With all this content available if he can filter through the “bullshit” we have an opportunity in front of us to be able to create. Services such as the one we use in class “codecademy” give us an extreme amount of opportunities to be successful as users of the internet. We have the decision to go forth and either fill the internet with clutter or create amazing services for people to use.

<h1>10 things I didn't know about HTML</h1>

<h1><a href="http://vimeo.com/89935203">10 things I didn't know about HTML</a></h1>
<p>
Our speaker opens up his speech by introducing his experience with HTML and Java and the multitude of things he has learned through it. Within the first few seconds of his speech he changes the title of "10 Things I didn't know about HTML" to "Infinite Things I didn't know about HTML." HTML can often appear to be valid as far as the DTD is concerned but oftern this is an error. He gives us an example of how the paragraph tag must appear in the body and never in the the heading. He goes on to inform us of common misconceptions that occur when coding font family names. Most people think that if there is whitespace in the font family name it must be quoted. This is not true however and your website will still validate without using these quotes.

<h1>Don't fear the internet</h1>

<h1><a href="http://vimeo.com/24006296">Don't fear the internet</a></h1>
<p>
Out speaker Russ Maschmeyer introduces our perception of the internet and how people commonly believe we are interconnected through invisible tubes. The internet is essentially just a connection of computers through wires that are run all over the earth. Through these connections we access other computers through servers and these are the backbone of the web. If we type in a web address to access a server we do not have the ability to edit anything on this server unless we have the username and password. I think it is interesting how he goes on to describe the importance of having multiple broswers. He goes on to give the example of how browsers are like vanilla ice cream, each one is slightly modified in it's own way in comparison to the next one. They are essentially the same, but they have little idiosyncracys that alter in the way they render css and html.
